AI-Powered English Placement TestThis is a web-based application designed to assess a user's English proficiency through automated, AI-powered analysis of their writing and speaking skills. It serves as a modern placement tool for English language training institutes.Live Demo: https://funny-belekoy-63f75e.netlify.app/FeaturesAI Writing Analysis: Users submit a short written response to a prompt.
